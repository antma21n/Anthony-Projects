# Alexa Smart Mirror
The Alexa Smart Mirror Project was a 2 phase project where I got some of my first software experince and building experience in college. This project was done in my apartment sophmore year. The first phase of the project was to create an Alexa device inside of a shoe box. The second phase, I took the experience from phase 1 and build a complete smart mirror. As this is one of my first projects I do not have alot of documentation other than pictures. Additionally, this was probably my first and largest failure of a project. I had multiple issues that I would later learn how to fix them later in my college career such as the Rasberry Pi over heating and a poor bulky design. 

## Details

### Phase 1
The first part of the project was to minimize the amount of hardware used and minimize cost in order to create functional proof of concept. The first phase of the project therefore, was a Alexa and a small display all contained in a shoe box.

#### Software
Raspberry PI and the standard OS it comes with is very powerful device for many projects. The PI is very much its own mini computer. For software used with the PI, Amazon has many devloper tools for making you own Alexa devices. This Alexa functionality is what gave the smart mirror its "inteligence". The UI of the magic mirror was created using a open source repository called MagicMirror2. MagicMirror2 was a very powerful repository which allowed virtually anything to be put on the mirror display.

### Phase 2

Phase 2 took the proof of concept of phase 1 and created an actual mirror. The mirror was all black with a computer monitor behind a 1 way piece of glass. At the time I did not know how to use CAD tools very well so most of this project was completely freehanded.

### Issues
This build had 2 major issues. By creating this project out of wood and not using any planning on how it would look like, the mirror quickly became very heavy and stuck out alot from the wall. The second issue was the device quickly overheated. At the time, I had not taken any thermodynamic classes yet. But, this device overheated because I did not realize how much heat was generated by the Raspberry Pi under continous use. The mirror had solid wood walls with no cut outs and it was painted in black. This caused the mirror to freeze and eventually fail.
