# Large CNC Router
Personal senior project that started in January 2021 and Construction Started in Summer of May 2021. Construction and first test were completed on July 2021. Project is currently is the test and tweaking phase as some build issues get ironed out such as the X-axis has some stuttle movement currently. 

## Details

### Original Creator
Ivan Miranda, a youtube personality was the original creator of this CNC machine. I took his design files and created my own while tweaking his project to suit my own needs. This included making the device smaller to fit in the garage while being big enough to fit imperial sheet of plywood rather than metric pieces of plywood.

### Software
This project utilizes an Arduino Uno to control motors of the CNC Router. The Arduino uses an open source firmware called GRBL. This software is simple to use with very little prior knowledged needed to use. To upload G-Code (pathing instructions for the spindle), Universal G-Code Sender (UGS) was used. UGS is another open source that allows users to upload and run G-Code of different types of machines and firmwares including GRBL.

### BOM
With Ivan being from another country, I had to create my own BOM and source my own materials. This project used alot of off the shelf parts from Amazon, Home Depot and for bulk orders, McMaster-Carr.

### Build
This build was done with basic hand tools outside of a metal grinder to cut the T-Slots.
